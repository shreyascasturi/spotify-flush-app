2. Change music taste?
   - Delete library -> start again
   - NEED: Save library -> list!
   - NEED: list -> all prior albums
   - NEED: Mass delete function
3. Given text file/csv file -> (re)-populate Spotify library

       1. list of saved albums -> |Spotify-flush-app| -> fill saved albums
   - Functionality 3: /delete/ album list
